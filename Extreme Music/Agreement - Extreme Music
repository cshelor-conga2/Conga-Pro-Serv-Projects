  <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>LICENSED USE.<br /><br /></strong></span>
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
      <li style="text-align: justify;">In consideration of the license fees set forth on Schedule "A" attached hereto ("License Fees"), Licensee shall have the non-exclusive right and license to record, synchronize, and reproduce the Musical Works in the Production and to exhibit, distribute,
        and otherwise publicly perform the Musical Works as embodied in the Production, as described on Schedule "A" attached hereto.<br /><br /></li>
      <li style="text-align: justify;">Licensee shall have the right to use the Musical Works, as synchronized and/or in timed relation with the Production as set forth on Schedule "A" attached hereto.<br /><br /></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>LICENSE FEE.</strong></span> All License Fees due to Extreme, as set forth on Schedule "A" shall be paid to Extreme on the earlier of (i) the complete execution of this Agreement, (ii) the initial distribution,
    sale, broadcast, performance, or exhibition of the Production, embodying the Musical Work, or (iii) the due date set forth on the applicable Invoice, whichever shall occur first. There shall be no valid license Agreement until payment of such License
    Fee. The License Fee shall be paid in its entirety in one (1) payment. Extreme and Licensee acknowledge that this Agreement grants the right, but not the obligation, to use the Musical Works in the Production. It is Licensee's responsibility to notify
    Extreme immediately in the event of any cancellation or change in Licensee's use of the Musical Works. If Licensee does not notify Extreme of any changes within thirty (30) days of the issuance of this Agreement: i) Licensee shall be given no credits
    or refunds in the event that the Production, or any portion thereof, does not air and ii) regardless of whether the Musical Works are used in the final edited version of the Production, Licensee shall remain obligated to pay the License Fee to Extreme
    and/or Extreme shall have the right to retain as its property all sums paid by Licensee to Extreme hereunder, free of any claim.<br /><br /></li>
  <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>RESERVATION OF RIGHTS.<br /><br /></strong></span>
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
      <li style="text-align: justify;">This Agreement does not authorize or permit any use of the Musical Works not expressly set forth herein, and all rights not expressly granted herein are specifically reserved to Extreme. Specifically, and without limiting the generality of the preceding
        sentence, Licensee shall not have the right, except with the prior written consent of Extreme in each instance, to alter the Musical Works (other than to shorten the Musical Works utilizing a contiguous portion thereof), utilize a parody lyric
        with such music, utilize the title or subtitle of the Musical Works as the title of the Production, translate or "re-dub" any or all of the lyrics contained in the Musical Works, or utilize the story of the Musical Works as the story of the Production.
        Notwithstanding the foregoing, Licensee may use the "Customix" tool on Extreme's website for the purposes of editing stems of the Musical Works. In the event that Licensee does use the Customix tool, Licensee shall only use the stems available
        on Extreme's website in isolation and shall not add any other musical or non-musical elements to the Musical Works, nor shall Licensee create any customized recording using the Customix tool which infringes the rights of any third party. Licensee
        shall report any and all usage of the mixed track to Extreme and the relevant Performance Right Societies using the original title and the original composer names and shares. If Licensee does alter, expand, adapt, edit, add to, subtract from,
        re-record, and/or remix the Musical Works using the Customix tool, Extreme shall maintain ownership of the sound recording(s) and/or musical composition(s) created in such a manner and such sound recording(s). In no instance, shall Licensee obtain
        any copyright ownership in the Musical Works whatsoever.<br /><br /></li>
      <li style="text-align: justify;">This Agreement does not authorize the use of any sound-alike or other re-recordings in which an artist (solo or group) performs the Musical Works in such a way as to imitate or otherwise re- produce an earlier recorded performance of the Musical
        Works.<br /><br /></li>
      <li style="text-align: justify;">All rights granted to Licensee in this Agreement, are granted on a non-exclusive, non- priority basis.<br /><br /></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>WARRANTIES AND REPRESENTATIONS.<br /><br /></strong></span>
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
      <li style="text-align: justify;">Licensee hereby warrants and represents that it shall be solely responsible for and shall pay, with respect to its use of the Musical Works as contemplated hereunder all costs relating whatsoever to the Production and Licensee's use of the Musical
        Works therein, including, without limitation, any costs relating or with respect to manufacturing, promoting, advertising, broadcasting, distributing, performing, and selling the same; and all applicable taxes and duties by reason of Licensee's
        activities hereunder. Licensee agrees that following written request by Extreme, it shall provide to Extreme a copy of the Production that contain the Musical Works, which shall be used by Extreme solely for its verification purposes and for no
        other purpose, no later than thirty (30) days following Extreme's written request therefor. Licensee warrants that it has obtained all necessary rights with respect to creating and producing the Production.<br /><br /></li>
      <li style="text-align: justify;">Extreme warrants and represents that (i) it owns or controls one hundred percent (100%) of the master sound recording and underlying musical copyright in and to the Musical Works, throughout the Territory (provided that such are protected by copyright),
        including all rights necessary to enter into and to fully perform the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and (ii) with respect to the non-dramatic public performance rights to musical compositions contained in each Musical Work, such rights
        are either (A) controlled by ASCAP, BMI, or SESAC (B) controlled by Extreme and not available from a performing rights society, in which case, such rights are granted to Licensee herein, or (C) in the public domain. Extreme acknowledges its obligation
        to, and agrees to obtain all requisite consents and permissions from all artists who appear on and writers who contributed to, the Musical Works and to pay all sums due in connection with such artists and writers (other than the amounts due in
        connection with the public performance of the musical compositions contained in each Musical Work) that result from or are connected with Licensee's use of the Musical Works.<br /><br /></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>INDEMNIFICATION.</strong></span> Extreme shall indemnify and hold Licensee harmless from and against any and all losses or expenses actually suffered, incurred or sustained by Licensee due to a breach
    of Extreme's warranties, representations or covenants under this Agreement resulting in a settlement entered into with Extreme's prior written consent or a final, non-appealable adverse judgment. In each instance in which a claim, action or proceeding
    is commenced against Licensee pertaining to Extreme's warranties, representations or covenants, Licensee shall promptly notify Extreme of such claim, action or proceeding, and Extreme shall have the sole and exclusive right to defend, control the
    defense of, and settle such action with counsel of Extreme's choice, and Licensee shall not be entitled independently either to settle such action or to incur any litigation costs, expenses or fees, without the express written approval of Extreme.
    For the avoidance of doubt, any judgment rendered against Licensee in such action, as well as any settlement approved in writing by Extreme, shall be paid in full by Extreme. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Licensee, insofar as its interests are affected,
    may, at its sole election, participate in any actions described hereunder using counsel of its own choosing at its sole expense.<br /><br /></li>
  <li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>MUSIC CUE SHEETS/MEDIA BUYS.</strong></span> It is the essence of this Agreement that Licensee furnish to Extreme and the appropriate performing rights societies, a cue sheet of the Production, within
    thirty (30) days following the initial broadcast, performance, or exhibition of the Production. For Productions that are commercial advertisements, Licensee shall also send to Extreme documentation regarding any and all media buys within thirty (30)
    days of the initial date of distribution of the Production.<br /><br /></li>
